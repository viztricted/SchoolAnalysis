# SchoolAnalysis
## The scripts in this notebook are used to analyze data about schools in the state of Washington.  The work is a part of a broader project for a client, but is evolving as my knowledge and experience with new tools and capabilities enables new analyses.  The initial work pulls publicly available data from the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) about public schools in Washington.  The process uses a Python notebook to clean and structure the data for feature engineering, processes the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans clustering to group similar schools.  The data is then published to a Tableau workbook for visualization and further analyses.
